## druid: Dimensionality Reduction Und IrgenDwas.
**druid** is a JavaScript library for dimensionality reduction with all necessary matrix operations and other needed algorithms built in. **druid** is influenced by the JavaScript visualization library [**d3**](https://d3js.org) and the python library [**scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

The idea of **druid** is, ...
- deliver tools for dimensionality reduction and matrix operations
- help build tools for showing your work (reproducabilty).

## Todos
- **Webworkerizer**: creates an HTML5 webworker to compute dimensionality reduction of a dataset.
- **DR algorithms**: OAP, LLE-Family (MLLE,...),...
- better algorithms for (approximative) nearest neighbor searches. NNDescent
- consistent style for usage of classes and methods. (parameter classes/interfaces?)
- add more clustering algorithms.
- add jsdocs everywhere :D complete documentation
- add tutorials, examples, "previews".
- and more...
